[general]
## Type:    string
## Default: root
#
# By default, urfkilld is ran with root privilege in order
# to open the device nodes. In case you have a security concern,
# set this variable to a valid username in the system, and then
# urfkilld will drop root privilege and switch to the user after
# the devices nodes are opened.
#
user=root

## Type:    boolean
## Default: TRUE
#
# This variable is to enable/disable the key control function
# in urfkill. While it's enabled, urfkilld will listen to
# WLAN/BLUETOOTH/WIMAX/UWB keys and change the states of the
# killswitches.
#
# Note: For the machines with hardware controlled rfkill keys,
#       it's recommended to set this variable to FALSE.
#
key_control=TRUE

# Type:    boolean
# Default: TRUE
#
# A master key is a key that controls all killswitches, and
# it's generally useful for the laptop with only one rfkill
# key.
#
# Note: Some platform drivers such as thinkpad-acpi control
#       the bluetooth killswitch by its own and only emit
#       WLAN key. In this case, the master key function will
#       conflict with the platform drivers, and it would be
#       better to set this variable to FALSE.
#
master_key=TRUE
