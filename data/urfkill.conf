# This option is to enable/disable the key control function
# in urfkill. While it's enabled, urfkilld will listen to
# WLAN/BLUETOOTH/WIMAX/UWB keys and change the states of the
# killswitches. If you have a laptop with the keys controlled
# by hardware, please set this option to false
# Default: true

# A master key is a key that controls all killswitches, and
# it's generally useful for the laptop with only one rfkill
# key. If you have a laptop with more than one rfkill key,
# please set this option to false.
